This Project is a showcase of the Digital Forensics capabilities found on Kali Linux. This has been provided by the University of Baltimore for students to practice and showcase their digital forensics skills. This is not a tutorial, just a showcase of my steps according to the information that has been provided. 
Below is a case sypnosis that was provided.

Beat Step is a company that produces sound effects for popular tv shows and movies.​ Two of Beat Step’s music files were stolen from the company and distributed over the Internet.​
One is a copyrighted file that was going to be used in an upcoming movie.​ The other is not copyrighted, but it was to be kept confidential. ​Beat Step hired you to determine who was responsible for taking the files and how they were able to do it.
Beat Step gave you the following information when discussing the case:​
The file ‘Contraband.mp3’ has a binary signature and is the copyrighted file. This file was planned to be included in the upcoming movie ‘Fate With Money’. ​
The file ‘Sample-1.mp3’ does not have a binary signature and is not the copyrighted file. However, the file was planned to be presented in a meeting. They want to know if the file was leaked by an employee.​
The MD5 and SHA1 hash of the .mp3 files were provided.​
Two possible suspects​
    - Kamryn Allen - referred to as user/suspect
    - Willis Gibbs - referred to as Gibbs
You have seized one suspect’s PC, Kamryn Allen​.

Your goals:​
Prove or disprove that Kamryn downloaded the .mp3 files.​
If copyrighted material is found, prove or disprove that it originated from the company.​
Determine how Kamryn acquired the copyrighted material if any are found.​
Look for any instances where Kamryn downloaded/shared the file(s) with someone else.​
Determine if there are other suspects that may have the file.
